# OVERLOAD

We are proud to present "OVERLOAD," an app designed to help neurotypical individuals understand and raise awareness about overstimulation. OVERLOAD allows users to experience the challenges that neurodivergent individuals face daily. By utilizing VR and 8D audio, we provide an immersive and realistic experience to convey the impact of overstimulation.
