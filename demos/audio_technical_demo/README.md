# audio_technical_demo

This is a technical demo showcasing the capabilities from Flutter's [SoLoud package](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_soloud). The primary goal of this experiment being to test the different effects and figure out how 3d sound works in practice. The documentation on the ``play3d`` function was insufficient and I had to rely on the [underlying framework's documentation](https://solhsa.com/soloud/core3d.html) to figure out how to implement it.

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have a (working-) version of Flutter installed.
2. Navigate to your (local-) folder containing this project.
3. Open a command prompt (``CTRL`` + ``SHIFT`` +  ``~``).
4. Execute ``flutter run``, I personally have not tried this specific tech demo on an emulator and recommend using a physical device.
5. I recommend using a headset/earbuds/earphones that uses stereo sound.
6. Play one of either sound samples.
7. Enjoy!

NOTE: There is a bug in some version of android that may cause the audio to suddenly spike to max volume, I do not know what causes this so beware of your ears.
